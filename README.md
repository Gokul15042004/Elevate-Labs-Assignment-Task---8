 Quiz Application

Description:
A simple quiz application is built using Java programming language.  
It asks multiple-choice questions, accepts user input, checks correctness, and displays the final score.  
The quiz uses recursion functions instead of loops to go through the questions.

 Features:
  - Multiple-choice questions with options  
  - Recursive function to ask questions  
  - Displays correct/incorrect feedback  
  - Shows final score at the end  

 Tools Used:
  -Java
  -Scanner for input  

 Working:
  1. Each question is stored as an object of the `Question` class.  
  2. A recursive function `askQuestions()` asks each question and checks the answer.  
  3. Correct answers add to the score.  
  4. At the end, the program shows the final score.
